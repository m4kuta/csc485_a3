Our system and Google Translate both capture the correct meaning of sentences 
(28) and (30) in the translation. However, Google Translate utilizes additional
words that are not in our system's lexicon, such as “mei yi” instead of 
“mei zhong” to express “every” in (28)'s translation and  "can" instead of 
"speaks" to express "huishuo" in (30)'s translation.
